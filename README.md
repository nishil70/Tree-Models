# Hidden Mark.. M.. (Project #2)

## Requirements
   Probabilistic states and transitions
1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Pick a text corpus dataset such as
https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays
or from https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
4. Formulate ideas on how machine learning can be used to learn word correlations and distributions within the dataset
5. Build a Hidden Markov Model to be able to programmatically
1. Generate new text from the text corpus
2. Perform text prediction given a sequence of words
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub
